    <div class="whats1">.....Today is the day I started this blog. I am working on sololearn.com. The first thing we are
        learning in html, besides tags and page set up is how to blog. The blog is pratice for all that we learn.
        I have never done this before and am getting a little ahead of the lesson. It just wanted to have me say a
        couple of words in an about section. I decided to have different pages for things. Also
        I have already started on my css. As you can see by my home page that I have also set up today as well.</div>
    </br>
    <p class="whats1">Today I learned about audio and video files. That was GREAT!! I learned something new!!! Now I
        just need a reason to use them.</p>

    <div class="whats2">..... Well I decided to blog today. I think I will add to the about page. Ya'll might want to
        know something about me.
        I coded yesterday. I learned new things in html, and css. I finished a basic html course and started a css one
        at sololearn.com.<br>
        Well, I finished up with my about page for now. Even included a picture of myself. So now it is off to code. I
        decided I should let
        you know anything I learn, and if it is significant i think i will start a code page where i can put my newley
        found code to refrence.

    <div class="date">Day 3, Nov 28, 2019</div>

    <div class="whats3">Yes, I know it is Thanksgiving. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!! I am working today on code and digital
        marketing today. As I have come to find out the hard way, if you want your websites to do good you need to know
        more than a bootcamp will teach you. Part of that is digital marketing.
        I went to WOZ-U a bootcamp for software developers. It was a 9 month school. I have a diploma. I can make
        beautiful websites.... I want to grow it into a sustaniable business though. Thats where the marketing comes in
        at.
        I also need to hone my website skills. I am by no means an expert web designer. I am on my way though...<br>
        I think today i will revisit video and audio files. As you can tell my chosen video comes up unavaliable..I am
        not sure why and would like to find out.
        O.K... I found out more about videos. So I included one from a class project that is narrated by my son.<br>
        <video controls="" height="340" width="420">
            <source src="./img/Pet Play Demo .mp4" type="video/mp4" />

            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        I hope you like it. It is a video of a dream of mine.<br>
        Now on to audio<br>

        <audio src="./img/Recording.m4a" type="audio/mpeg" controls>
            I'm sorry. You're browser doesn't support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

        <br>
        IT WORKED!!!!!<br>

    <div class="whats4">
        Well I hope everyone enjoyed there Thanksgiving. We are having ours today. It is still early yet so I am coding.
        I just thought that this was neat:<br>
        background-size: contain; I knew about cover. It dosent always work the way you want but now I have found
        contain!! Lets see how it works: <br>
        <div class="whats4div1">contain</div>
        <div class="whats4div2">cover</div> <br>
        Well I think that worked beautifully. <br>
        GREAT news!!!! I just got my acceptiance letter to Colorado State University Global. CSU Global. This is where I
        will be getting
        a bachalors degree in computer science. First I will be going through a certificate program I think will help me
        out with freelance work in the
        long run.<br>
        I attended WOZ-U last year. it was good it taught me a lot in a little amount of time. Enough to know I want to
        learn more.
        ...I learned today that css3 has natual animations. You just name them and make them up. ex: Hover over this
        square: <br>


        <div class="animation"></div> <br>
        YES!!  I finished Sololearn"s css fundamentals course and got my certificate!! YAY!! <br>

    <div class="date">Day 5, Nov 30, 2019</div>


    <div class="whats5">
        Today I started off by moving my Blog folder to GitHub.   https://github.com
        . It is a place in computerLand where your code is stored. It keeps a master copy of your code and you can make
        changes to it in branches.
        Once you decide the branch wont mess anything up you can commit it to the master. Not that that is all it does,
        but thats kinda an explnation. <br>
        Well the next thing I was going to do at solo learn was javascript.  The class I start with at CSU  Global starts with Python.  So I am going to start on that 
        today to try to get a head start on it.  I have no prior knowledge of Python. <br>
        Sooo... Here's whats up so far.  Sololearn started out like I knew something about Python.  So I had to go to Udemy.  I Love Udemy.
        This is the class I chose  https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-absolute-beginners-u   It is great for beginners cause it shows you where to start from.
        It starts with downloading Python then a text editor for it.  Then it shows you how to use the text editor.  A text editor is what you use to write code in.  I usually use visual studio code but  for python I am using 
        JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition.  I have just finished my first lesson.  I will let you know how it goes.
        Well it has been going great.  I can say that I have learned a lot in a very understandable format.  only 30% done with class but i highly reccomend it.
        I got as far as getting things to populate into the terminal.  Still when you get there your pretty proud of yourself.
        Well I think I am done for now. Ive gone over a lot of material.  I think it will have helped me a lot to have taken this course
