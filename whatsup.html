    <div class="whats1">.....Today is the day I started this blog. I am working on sololearn.com. The first thing we are
        learning in html, besides tags and page set up is how to blog. The blog is pratice for all that we learn.
        I have never done this before and am getting a little ahead of the lesson. It just wanted to have me say a
        couple of words in an about section. I decided to have different pages for things. Also
        I have already started on my css. As you can see by my home page that I have also set up today as well.</div>
    </br>
    <p class="whats1">Today I learned about audio and video files. That was GREAT!! I learned something new!!! Now I
        just need a reason to use them.</p>

    <div class="date">Day 2, Nov 27, 2019</div>

    <div class="whats2">..... Well I decided to blog today. I think I will add to the about page. Ya'll might want to
        know something about me.
        I coded yesterday. I learned new things in html, and css. I finished a basic html course and started a css one
        at sololearn.com.<br>
        Well, I finished up with my about page for now. Even included a picture of myself. So now it is off to code. I
        decided I should let
        you know anything I learn, and if it is significant i think i will start a code page where i can put my newley
        found code to refrence.

    <div class="date">Day 3, Nov 28, 2019</div>

    <div class="whats3">Yes, I know it is Thanksgiving. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!! I am working today on code and digital
        marketing today. As I have come to find out the hard way, if you want your websites to do good you need to know
        more than a bootcamp will teach you. Part of that is digital marketing.
        I went to WOZ-U a bootcamp for software developers. It was a 9 month school. I have a diploma. I can make
        beautiful websites.... I want to grow it into a sustaniable business though. Thats where the marketing comes in
        at.
        I also need to hone my website skills. I am by no means an expert web designer. I am on my way though...<br>
        I think today i will revisit video and audio files. As you can tell my chosen video comes up unavaliable..I am
        not sure why and would like to find out.
        O.K... I found out more about videos. So I included one from a class project that is narrated by my son.<br>
        <video  class="video responsive"  >
            <source src="./img/Pet Play Demo .mp4" type="video/mp4" />

            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        I hope you like it. It is a video of a dream of mine.<br>
        Now on to audio<br>

        <audio class="recordimg1 responsive" src="./img/Recording.m4a" type="audio/mpeg" controls>
            I'm sorry. You're browser doesn't support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

        <br>
        IT WORKED!!!!!<br>

    <div class="date">Day 4, Nov 29, 2019</div>

    <div class="whats4">
        Well I hope everyone enjoyed there Thanksgiving. We are having ours today. It is still early yet so I am coding.
        I just thought that this was neat:<br>
        background-size: contain; I knew about cover. It dosent always work the way you want but now I have found
        contain!! Lets see how it works: <br>

        <div class=" canvas1 whats4div1  ">contain</div><br>
        <div class="canvas1  whats4div2 ">cover</div> <br>

        Well I think that worked beautifully. <br>
        GREAT news!!!! I just got my acceptiance letter to Colorado State University Global. CSU Global. This is where I
        will be getting
        a bachalors degree in computer science. First I will be going through a certificate program I think will help me
        out with freelance work in the
        long run.<br>
        I attended WOZ-U last year. it was good it taught me a lot in a little amount of time. Enough to know I want to
        learn more.
        ...I learned today that css3 has natual animations. You just name them and make them up. ex: Hover over this
        square: <br>


        <div class="animation"></div> <br>
        YES!!  I finished Sololearn"s css fundamentals course and got my certificate!! YAY!! <br>

    <div class="date">Day 5, Nov 30, 2019</div>


    <div class="whats5">
        Today I started off by moving my Blog folder to GitHub.   https://github.com
        . It is a place in computerLand where your code is stored. It keeps a master copy of your code and you can make
        changes to it in branches.
        Once you decide the branch wont mess anything up you can commit it to the master. Not that that is all it does,
        but thats kinda an explnation. <br>
        Well the next thing I was going to do at solo learn was javascript.  The class I start with at CSU  Global starts with Python.  So I am going to start on that 
        today to try to get a head start on it.  I have no prior knowledge of Python. <br>
        Sooo... Here's whats up so far.  Sololearn started out like I knew something about Python.  So I had to go to Udemy.  I Love Udemy.
        This is the class I chose  https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-absolute-beginners-u   It is great for beginners cause it shows you where to start from.
        It starts with downloading Python then a text editor for it.  Then it shows you how to use the text editor.  A text editor is what you use to write code in.  I usually use visual studio code but  for python I am using 
        JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition.  I have just finished my first lesson.  I will let you know how it goes.
        Well it has been going great.  I can say that I have learned a lot in a very understandable format.  only 30% done with class but i highly reccomend it.
        I got as far as getting things to populate into the terminal.  Still when you get there your pretty proud of yourself.
        Well I think I am done for now. Ive gone over a lot of material.  I think it will have helped me a lot to have taken this course.

        Today I finished my Udemy class Python 101 for beginners.  I thimk it was a great class!!  I went ahead and startedon the sololearn
        class today.  I learned Enough from udemy to tackle it.  So far so goood.  I learned to much to share with you. I would advise taking 
        the Udemy course.  I have been up since 1:30 am and am on the end of my second pot of coffee.  I think I need a break from code for a bit.
          ...So  I think I will work on my projects page a little.  Well managed to take care of that.  There are now videos of my 
          work on my projects page.  I hope ya'll enjoy my work.  Well I have been at it pretty much all day.  It is time to call it a day.  I may design some,
          I wouldnt mind playing around with some design for a bit though.

        I know it has been a few day, things get hectic you know...  I am just startin out in code today , not quite sure what I am gonna be working on just yet.  I did decide to add some more code 
        to the code page.  It is a responsive code I use with all my whackadoodle stuff that wont act right.  Like pictures for example.  Speaking of responsiveness i have got to work on that.  I havent done anything to make this site responsive yet.  It will get there though.
         Well I studied a little at sololearn.  I have also added a dropdown date menu 
        for this page to make it easier to navigate.  I also filled out some stuff for CSU Global.  Then I navigated there site taking a look around and getting 
        familiar with it.  I start in 5 days.

        Well school has started. There is going to be a lot of writing involved. I am starting out in the python language. 
        my first assignment is to make a mouse in code. How kool.  Admittedly, I havent been coding much lately, reading mostly.
        coding  will  come though.
    </div>

    <div class="date">Day 9, Dec 13, 2019</div>

    <div class="whats8"|>
        Today I coded a mouse in python.  I guess not a big deal, but fun.  I like making shapes and things in python.
        I also learned escape in python.  I will try to explane escap a bit... When you print something in python it looks like this:    print('Hello There')
        ...That will print out hello there but say you wanted a \ in there, you would have to put another set of quotes around it in order for it to be printed as a \  because python thinks that \ is a symbol 
        so , for python to know its not a symbol, You just put  quotes around it and it should go ahead and work.

        School is going well I think.  There is a lot of reading involved some coding. Python seems to flow smoothly. 
         So far I like it. I am going to try to find more time to code.  Right now still at the basics. learned about strings and variables. 
         How to take in input for them.  Only how to show output in console though.  I hope that we develop a full stack app 
         while in CSU Global.  I have a few apps that I need to be working on.  I need to finish the Happy Furrbabies website.  Make a recepie 
         app, I have the database set up for it. I really need to do a professional portfolio website.  I need more time in the day!!

       School is 2 weeks in.  Not so bad. Grades are good so far. Still in python and web development. 
       I love Python.  It is very simple and stright forward. I highly recomend it as a language to start out with.
       I havent learned any libarys or frameworks yet, but so far so good.

     Well, I cannot understand why I have been away so long. Granted there is school , work, and everyday life going on
     but I really need to dedicate more time to this.  I think it is kind of  lifeless to only tell you of theory. 
     Right now I am doing a lot of theory.<br>
     I checked over my "in process"  websites.  I was very upset to learn that one was broken. One needs to be reconnected
     to a ddatabase.  The other just needs work.  I need to set up a Trello board for each project.  A Trello board helps 
     you keep track of your project tasks. What they are, Where you are at with them, and When they are finished.I also
     have 2 final projects due in 3 weeks.  I think I will start with the Trello boards first.  This will also give me
     a chance to gather my thoughts about each website.  This is an example of a Trello Board:<br>

    I learned that python is an object orientated Prograam.  So best as I understand,  everything is an object and you add functionality to ti. 
    I also made a new website. Hope yall like it. It is in the projects page.

    As I sit here with close personal greef during the middle of the covid-19 outbreak eating a 1/2 gallon of ice creame 
    I wonder if I  may be wrong. I'm not going into the details of what has happned, just that they have been life changing.
    So the problem I face now is staying focused.  I am beginning to wonder if I will ever code again.  We will see...

    Hello ALL!!  I am proud to say that I am coding agian.  
    Things are going well.  Sorry about the last post but I am going to let it stand.
    I am back in school.  Taking a Social Media Certification class. 
    Also am going to the bootcamp Praticum by Yandex.  It is very hard,
     it seems advanced.  Just what I need!! I am working very hard 
     on both.  I have also started a business.  I am proud to say 
     that (we will call him "J" for now) J and I will be working
      together in this venture.  I will be responsibel for front-end 
      and he will be responsible for back-end.  As a team I think we 
      can form a strong business aliance for ourselves.  I will also 
      be responsible for finding business and SEO pratices if anyone so choses.
      Oh by the way the company is called Lynch Web Design and Digital 
      Marketing.
